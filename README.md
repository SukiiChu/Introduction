𝑯𝒂𝒊𝒊𝒊^^ 𝑰𝒎 𝑺𝒖𝒌𝒊, y'all can find me in the Sonic area mostly as Shadow always on the same spot (or a few pixels away🫡)  chilling with my friends. Feel free to int but please dont cover my friends or make them uncomfortable🙏 (Thank you❣️). I dont bite at all and im friendly but sometimes when im anxious I can go semi-mute. I prefer party chat and whispers, using local chat makes me anxious since I have social anxeity. I use English every day but its not my native language so its possible I might write something incorrectly (Sorry). Im very friendly and patient until you dont give me a good reason to not be (it happens very rarely tho but I can't stand mean people).


𝑭𝒓𝒊𝒆𝒏𝒅𝒔: I love yall so much and hugs for y'all❣️ Feel free to int and sit with me anytime♡

𝑬𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒚𝒐𝒏𝒆: Int freely (I might be busy/afk/semi-afk sometimes, I prefer whispers).  Yall are all amazing people, even if its hard sometimes please try to stay positive it'll be better trust, I believe in yall💕
